## Optimizations  

To ensure the game runs smoothly and provides an enjoyable experience on a variety of hardware, the following optimizations were implemented:  

- **Baked Lighting**: Used baked lighting instead of dynamic lighting where possible to significantly reduce runtime performance overhead.  
- **Nanite System**: Integrated Unreal Engine's Nanite system for handling high-detail meshes efficiently, allowing for better performance without compromising visual quality.  
- **Level of Detail (LOD)**: Applied LODs to meshes, ensuring that less detailed versions of objects are rendered when viewed from a distance, thereby improving frame rates.  
- **AMD FSR 3.1**: Implemented AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.1 with Frame Generation to provide better upscaling and smoother gameplay, especially on lower-end systems.  
- **Graphics Presets and Auto Settings**: Designed custom graphics presets and included an auto-detection feature that adjusts settings based on the user's hardware benchmark.  
- **Optimized Textures and Materials**: Reduced texture sizes and optimized materials to balance performance and quality.  

These optimizations ensure that the game maintains high visual fidelity while running efficiently on a wide range of hardware configurations.
